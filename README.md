#About this project

I made this homepage as a project to learn more about how JavaScript can work along side HTML and CSS to style a website.
I wanted to learn how to use eventListners with different type of elements.
I will probably revisit this project ever now and then to add more functionality, but this is where I stop for now.

It is nothing fancy, but I wanted to experiment and learn as I tried new things.
